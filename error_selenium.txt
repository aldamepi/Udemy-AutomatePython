ERROR: After October 2020 you may experience errors when installing or updating packages. This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.

We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.

conda 4.10.3 requires ruamel_yaml_conda>=0.11.14, which is not installed.
conda-repo-cli 1.0.4 requires pathlib, which is not installed.
requests 2.24.0 requires urllib3!=1.25.0,!=1.25.1,<1.26,>=1.21.1, but you'll have urllib3 1.26.8 which is incompatible.
